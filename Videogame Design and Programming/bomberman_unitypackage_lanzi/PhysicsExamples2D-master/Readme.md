# 2D Physics Examples
This project contains multiple scenes which are designed to provide both examples of features as well as having the additional benefit that they can be used by Unity QA or developers who want to test that specific features are working away from their projects.

A lot of the scenes rely on Gizmos for presentation of Colliders, Joints, Contacts (etc) so please ensure that the "Gizmos" buttons are selected in both the "Scene" and "Game" views otherwise you may find you cannot see the content.

Where a new feature is introduced into the project, a new branch will be introduced when the Unity version that feature landed has become public in at least a Beta version. Earlier Unity versions are therefore represented in branches.
